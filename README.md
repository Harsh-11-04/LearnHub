## 📘 Project Overview
**LearnHub** is a peer-to-peer learning and resource sharing platform built as an academic project. It focuses on collaborative learning by allowing users to share study materials, organize resources by subject, and participate in community-driven learning activities.

The project emphasizes clean architecture, reusable components, and strong TypeScript domain models, and is designed to be extendable with backend services in the future.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Enable students to share learning resources (notes, PDFs, videos, links)
- Organize resources by subject and tags
- Encourage peer participation through ratings and contributions
- Provide a scalable foundation for study groups and Q&A discussions

---

## ✨ Features

### ✅ Implemented
- Resource upload and shared resource feed
- Subject-based categorization and tagging
- 1–5 star rating system for resources
